						"I wanted to create this game from scratch, to better understand how game engines work under the hood. The biggest challenge surfaced when I discovered that the tutorial I was following didn't actually bring the game to a basic completion. The series had left me with a solid foundation, no doubt, consisting of a tile map loader, a game camera, keyboard input and a hero to control, some basic collision detection, and some entity handling. The rest was up to me. Did I really want to stick this through, knowing it would be extremely challenging? In the end, I had to fully immerse myself in to this code base, and really learn how it worked in order to achieve the results that I desired. It was a wonderful learning experience."

						"Are you all right? What's wrong? I felt a great disturbance in the Force...as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened. You'd better get on with your exercises. Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em. Don't everyone thank me at once. Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours. Now be careful, Artoo. He made a fair move. Screaming about it won't help you. Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee. But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid. That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that. I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee win.",
						"He says he's found the main computer to power the tractor beam that's holding the ship here. He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor. The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave. I don't think you boys can help. I must go alone. Whatever you say. I've done more that I bargained for on this trip already. Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch over the droids. But he can...",
						"It looks like an Imperial cruiser. Our passengers must be hotter than I thought. Try and hold them off. Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed. Stay sharp! There are two more coming in, they're going to try to cut us off. Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast. Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home. We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them! Here's where the fun begins!",
						"You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen. What makes you think that? Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi. I thought he might have meant old Ben. Do you know what he's talking about? Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben. That old man's just a crazy old wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed. That'll be the end of it. It belongs to us now. But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him? He won't, I don't think he exists any more. He died about the same time as your father. He knew my father? I told you to forget it. Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow. In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.",
						"What? Yahoo! Look out! You're all clear, kid. Now let's blow this thing and go home! Stand by to fire at Rebel base. Standing by. Great shot, kid. That was one in a million. Remember, the Force will be with you...always."
